# Servers manager

A simple tool to manage servers represented by docker containers on the machine.  
It allows to start, stop, restart and view containers logs with sockets for real-time updates.  
Only whitelisted discord ids can login to the app.

MongoDB is currently useless but it can be usefull for future features.

**I made this project for fun so there are lots of things to improve :)**
